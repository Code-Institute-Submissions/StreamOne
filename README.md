# Overview
## What is the website for?
### This is a website for the German music band â€“ Rammstein.
### Purpose
The site consists of several webpages containing information about Rammstein. Users can explore the creativity of the group by reviewing the information provided. Each page presents a different aspect of the group's work. Viewers can enjoy video clips, each of which illustrate or recreates in an intriguing way the words of the vocal. The site also includes just audio files. Users can read information about the group's history and musical direction, as well as brief curriculum vitae on the professional development of its members. All six studio albums are shown in sequential order of their release years + songs as well as their duration. An option for users to contact the group is provided.
### How does it work?
The site uses bootstrap to give aesthetically pleasing appearance to many of its components. The background and atmosphere of the site as a whole has dark and heavy nuances to be in tune with the group's appearance as well as the themes and the mood of the songs. The site also uses Javascript and JQyery for the message box and for the albums and the changing background when they highlighted their track lists. The site can be seen here.
## Features
### Navigation
Site pages are linked in a way that allows users to access any other page by just one click. Part of the information on some pages is hidden so that the user can only focus on the topic he/she wants. For example, a very useful feature of bootstrap with dropdown panels is used on the page containing text about the group and its members, which only reveals the information from the panel that the user chooses, with the previous panel automatically retracting and leaving only its title.
### Eye catching - all pages of the site have a dark background and heavy nuances to match the group's looks and theme and mood of their songs. In contrast to the background, the text is bright to stand out and is easier to read and perceive by the user. In bright sunlight, light text on a dark background is better readable (for example, when viewing the site via mobile devices outside enclosed premises). The front page is most dynamic, compared to the rest of the webpages, containing slideshow of the bands spectacular live concerts. It also contains video and audio materials to allow the user to feel the spirit and creativity of the band from his first touch with the site.
### Information displayed in the website
All pages (without contact us) provide information in a different form for the group. On the first page, the user can see the investments and efforts made by the group to make their video clips, most of which visually reproduce what happened in the song rather than just showing the band in a stage appearance. The third page shows all the studio albums released by the group and the songs that they contain. The second page provides information in the form of text telling about the musical direction of the group and information about the professional career of its members.
### Media used
The site provides users with the opportunity to enjoy the video clips of the band as well as audio performances. The site includes photos of the band and their live performances so that the user can plunge into the atmosphere the group creates. Each member is shown with a photo.
